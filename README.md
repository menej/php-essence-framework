# php-essence-framework

This is a simple and intuitive PHP MVC framework that can be used for small or medium-sized projects.

### public

This is the PHP server directory where we start our server. It is essential to set the document root when booting up the
server. For example: `php -S localhost:8888 -t public`. This directory also stores CSS and JS files, hiding
other files from the public.

#### routes.php

This document serves as documentation for available routes and for use with a router in an MVC structure. It returns an
array containing all available routes.

Example of a valid route:

```php
<?php

return [
  "/" => [
      'GET' => ['IndexController', 'index']
  ]
];
```

Explanation:

- `/` - represents the URL route
- `GET` - represents the HTTP request type
- `['IndexController', 'index']` - the controller name is the first argument, and the second is the method inside the
  controller.

### index.php

This is the router of the project, routing different URL requests with their related controllers and methods. The
router supports four HTTP requests: GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE. No special handling needs to be added for processing HTTP requests with a GET or POST method. However, when needing to specify a PATCH or DELETE method, it is essential to add to a submitting form an input element with type hidden, an attribute name with the value "_method" and an attribute value of the needed method uppercased.
Note that the form type attribute value should be POST when using HTTP methods other than GET requests.

A RESTful approach is recommended, meaning the use of function names inside the controller:

```
index (example: show all notes) - GET
show (example: show details of a note) - GET
edit (example: show a form to edit a note) - GET
update (example: update a note) - POST/PATCH
create (example: show a form to create a note) - GET
store (example: store a note) - POST
delete (example: show a form to delete a note) - GET
destroy (example: delete a note) - POST/DELETE
```

If no corresponding method inside a controller is found, it shows a 404 error page. If a database error occurs, it shows
a 400 error page.

### config

Inside the sql directory, there is a db.sql file representing a physical database model. config.php holds the
configuration details of a database.

### core

This directory is used for utilities.

#### functions.php

Here are defined functions that can be used throughout the whole project. Some examples are `base_path($path)`
function, which we put in as an argument a path, returns us the whole path from the base. Another example is the
`controller($path)` function, which does a similar thing, but returns the directory to the controller.

#### Response.php

This class is used for defining supported errors.

#### Session.php

This class is used to handle user sessions. Methods include:

```
put($key, $value)
get($key, $default = null)
has($key)
login($user)
logout()
```

#### Validator.php

This is where functions for validations and filters are defined. Consider an Authentication class to handle user
authentication.

#### ViewHelper.php

This class helps display a view to the user. Methods include:

```
render($file, $variables = [])
redirect($url)
abort($code = 404, $message ="")
```

### controller

This directory stores controllers. An example, `IndexController.php`, demonstrates how the logic works.

```php
<?php

namespace controller;

require base_path('core/ViewHelper.php');

use core\ViewHelper;

class IndexController
{
    public static function index(): void
    {
        $variables = ["title" => "Home"];
        ViewHelper::render('index.view.php', $variables);
    }
}
```

### view

This directory stores views. Views should be named in a way, that signifies a view - NAME.view.php. Semantically
corresponding views should fall into the same directory with the same name as their controller. The partials pattern injects the head and foot of the HTML document to decrease redundancy.

It's important to note that, due to this pattern, a title should be included in a $variables array before rendering each
view.

For instance, consider the `index.view.php` file:"

```php
<?php require "partials/head.php" ?>

<main>
    <p>Hello. Welcome to the home page!</p>
</main>

<?php require "partials/footer.php" ?>
```

If we were to pass some variables into the view, these should also be documented above the script in the following manner:
```php
<?php
/**
 * @var string $title
 * @var string $name
 * @var int $age
 */
?>

<?php require "partials/head.php" ?>

<main>
    <p>Hello <?= $name ?>, you are <?= $age ?> old!</p>
</main>

<?php require "partials/footer.php" ?>

```

### model

This directory stores models. The models should be named after the object they represent, preferably in a singular sense (e.g., note, user).

#### DBInit.php

The `DBInit` class, located in the `model` namespace, provides a singleton interface for initializing a PDO (PHP Data
Objects) connection to a MySQL database.

#### Usage

To obtain an instance of the PDO connection, use the `getInstance` method of the `DBInit` class.

```php
use model\DBInit;

// Get a PDO instance
$pdo = DBInit::getInstance();
```

Note: For now, `DBInit::getInstance()` needs to be utilized at the beginning of each models function to initiate the 
database instance. To address this in the future, consider implementing Automatic Dependency Injection.


#### Configuration

The database configuration is loaded from an external configuration file (`config/config.php`). Ensure that this file
contains the necessary database parameters described previously.

#### PDO Configuration
The PDO instance is configured with the following options:

- The error mode is set to `PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION` for robust error handling.
- The default fetch mode is set to `PDO::FETCH_ASSOC` for associative array results.
- Persistence enabled (`PDO::ATTR_PERSISTENT`) for maintaining a persistent connection.
- MySQL character set initialized to UTF-8 (`PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND`).
